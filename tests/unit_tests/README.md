# CRISPResso2 Unit Tests

Testing CRISPResso2 is done using `pytest`, and you can run `pytest tests` from the root of the project.
If you get errors, make sure that the version of `pytest` you installed matches the version of Python in your environment.
If you get errors about not being able to import the CRISPResso modules, make sure that you specify the directory (e.g. `pytest tests`).
